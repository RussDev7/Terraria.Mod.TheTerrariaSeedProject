Your world seed search engine. You want a world with
5 Pyramids or no evil in jungle? With this mod you can find a world seed which has both of it.
Amaze your friends with playing worlds you didn't thought they even can exist. Share your rare findings with the community.
The seeds you found can also be used in the unmodded vanilla version.

[c/BBDDBB:To enter the seed search mode] start either your world name or seed with "?" (question mark without quotes). 
E.g. "?my Map name", or "?133742" as seed or just "?" (all without quotes) 

New! https://discord.gg/6HXKa9a

Currently you can search for:

-Number of Pyramids, Clouds, Living Trees and their items
-If evil tiles can destroy your Jungle, Desert or Ice 
-evil biome spawn side after enter Hardmoe (in Jungle or not)
-If you can get a Water Bolt or even a Dungeon chest before Skeletron        
-The Color of the Dungeon and if all kind of Walls
-Can you get rare items like Flower Boots, Seaweed or Fish pet
-How many different paintings and statues
-How good the beach looks, no cliff no gabs, no near evil
-If you spawn on top of a cloud, in Snow or Jungle biome
-How far you need to walk to Dungeon, Temple your first Boots
-If it has an active Enchanted Sword Shrine
-other rare stuff like a Dungeon in Snow Biome
          
...And many many more (look linked page for full list (>200))

During world generation it checks if this map is suitable. If not it takes the next seed. Many conditions don't need the fully generated world. With this you can save much search time. You can check over 100 seed per minute.

This mod does not change the generated World. It only evaluates what was done.

More details at mod page or at in-game description.

If you found some bugs, have some ideas, want to help coding or found some nice seeds do not hesitate writing me in linked mod page.

Good luck!
