# Terraria.Mod.TheTerrariaSeedProject

During world generation it checks if this map is suitable. If not it takes the next seed. Many conditions don't need the fully generated world. With this you can save much search time. You can check over 100 seed per minute.

This mod does not change the generated World. It only evaluates what was done.
